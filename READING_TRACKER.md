# Reading Tracker – What to Read Next & Where to Continue

> **Purpose:** Simple place to track **what you’re reading**, **where you stopped**, and **what to read next**, across all your docs.

Use this rule:
- After each reading session, **update one row** in the table.
- Inside the doc, add a marker like `<!-- CONTINUE_READING_FROM_HERE -->` at the next section to resume.

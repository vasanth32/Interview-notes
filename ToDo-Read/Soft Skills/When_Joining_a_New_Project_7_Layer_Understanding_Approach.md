When joining a new project, the biggest mistake many developers make is **jumping directly into code**.
Instead, follow a **structured 7-layer understanding approach** — this helps you become productive in **1–2 weeks instead of months**.

Below is a **practical checklist tailored for a Senior .NET developer**.

## When Joining a New Project — What You Must Understand

### 1. Business Understanding (Most Important)

First understand **why the system exists**.

Know:

- What problem this application solves
- Who are the users (customers, admin, partners)
- Major business flows (Order flow, Payment flow, etc.)
- Critical revenue-impacting modules

Ask:

- “Which modules are most critical to business?”

---

### 2. End-to-End Functional Flow

Understand complete request flow:

- UI → API → Services → Database → External systems
- Synchronous vs asynchronous flows
- Background jobs / schedulers

Create a simple **flow diagram for yourself**.

---

### 3. Architecture Overview

Understand:

- Monolith or Microservices
- API Gateway usage
- Messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ / Service Bus)
- Caching (Redis)
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS / Azure)

Key question:

- “How does one request travel through the system?”

---

### 4. Codebase Structure

Learn:

- Solution structure
- Shared libraries
- Core domain modules
- Where business logic actually lives

Tip:  
Start reading **Controllers → Services → Repository** flow.

---

### 5. Environment & Deployment

Understand:

- Dev / QA / Prod environments
- CI/CD pipeline
- Deployment process
- Config management (Secrets, environment variables)

---

### 6. Logs, Monitoring & Debugging

Know:

- Where logs are stored
- How to debug production issues
- Monitoring dashboards (AppInsights, CloudWatch, Kibana)

This is what **senior engineers are expected to know quickly**.

---

### 7. Current Pain Points (Very Powerful Career Move)

Ask team:

- Which modules fail frequently?
- Performance bottlenecks?
- Technical debt areas?

Working on these areas makes you **visible very fast**.

---

## First 10 Days Smart Plan (Highly Recommended)

### Day 1–2

- Business flow understanding
- Architecture walkthrough

### Day 3–5

- Run application locally
- Debug 2–3 real flows

### Day 6–8

- Fix small bug / small enhancement

### Day 9–10

- Document what you learned (very powerful habit)

---

## Golden Rule (Most Important)

In a new project your first goal is **understanding**, not **coding speed**.

Developers who understand:

- flow
- architecture
- dependencies

become **go-to engineers** quickly.

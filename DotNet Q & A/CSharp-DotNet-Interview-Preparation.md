## Q1. Value Type vs Reference Type: What really changes at runtime? [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
In production code, what practical differences matter between value types and reference types beyond textbook definitions?

### Simple Answer
Value types store data directly; reference types store a reference to data. Copying a value type copies data; copying a reference type copies the reference.

### Interview Answer
The real impact is around copy cost, mutation behavior, nullability, and API contract clarity. With value types, accidental copying can hurt performance if the struct is large. With reference types, shared mutable state can cause hard-to-debug side effects. In high-throughput code, I use small immutable structs for hot paths and classes for identity-based objects. I also avoid mutable structs because callers often assume reference-like behavior and introduce subtle bugs.

### Deep Explanation
- Value types usually live inline where declared (stack for local variables, inline in arrays/objects for fields), but can still be boxed to the heap.
- Reference types are heap-allocated (except some runtime optimizations) and accessed via object references.
- Equality semantics differ by default: value types compare field values (unless overridden), classes compare reference identity unless equality is overridden.
- Large structs passed by value can create hidden copying overhead.

### Example
```csharp
public struct Money
{
    public decimal Amount;
    public string Currency;
}

public class Invoice
{
    public Money Total;
}

var a = new Money { Amount = 100, Currency = "USD" };
var b = a;
b.Amount = 200;
// a.Amount is still 100 because b is a copy

var i1 = new Invoice { Total = a };
var i2 = i1;
i2.Total.Amount = 300;
// i1.Total.Amount is now 300 because i1 and i2 reference the same Invoice object
```

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming all value types are always on the stack.
- Creating large mutable structs and passing them around by value.
- Confusing object identity with value equality.

### Follow-up Questions
- When would you choose readonly struct?
- What problems come from mutable structs in collections?
- How does passing struct by in reduce copies?

---

## Q2. Stack vs Heap: Is it really that simple? [ADVANCED]

### Question
Interviewers ask stack vs heap. What is the senior-level answer?

### Simple Answer
Stack is for call frames and local lifetime management; heap is for dynamically allocated objects managed by GC.

### Interview Answer
I explain that stack vs heap is a useful model but not absolute. In .NET, what matters more is allocation rate, object lifetime, and GC pressure. Some locals are optimized into registers, and value types can be embedded inside heap objects. So I optimize for fewer allocations in hot paths, reduced Gen 2 pressure, and fewer LOH allocations.

### Deep Explanation
- Stack allocations are typically fast and scoped to method calls.
- Heap allocations participate in garbage collection and can fragment memory patterns.
- Boxing value types allocates on heap.
- Large arrays/objects go to LOH and have different collection behavior.

### Example
```csharp
// High-allocation pattern in tight loop
for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
{
    var s = i.ToString(); // allocates string each iteration
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Over-optimizing micro-allocation without profiling.
- Assuming stack always equals fast and heap always equals slow.

### Follow-up Questions
- How do you detect allocation hotspots?
- What counters do you monitor in production?

---

## Q3. Boxing and Unboxing: Why does it still matter? [ADVANCED]

### Question
Where do boxing issues appear in modern enterprise code?

### Simple Answer
Boxing converts a value type to object/interface and allocates; unboxing extracts it back to a value type.

### Interview Answer
Boxing still appears in logging, non-generic collections, and interface-based calls on structs. In high-volume APIs, repeated boxing can increase allocation rate and GC churn. I avoid it by using generics, strongly typed APIs, and checking logger templates for hidden formatting allocations.

### Deep Explanation
- Boxing creates a heap object wrapper.
- Unboxing requires exact type and can throw invalid cast exception.
- Common hidden source: calling interface methods on structs when constrained poorly.

### Example
```csharp
int x = 42;
object o = x;    // boxing
int y = (int)o;  // unboxing
```

### Common Mistakes
- Using ArrayList or non-generic APIs in performance-critical code.
- Ignoring boxing inside tight loops.

### Follow-up Questions
- How can you detect boxing from performance traces?
- Why can logging patterns trigger boxing?

---

## Q4. ref vs out vs in: Which one should you use and when? [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
How do you choose between ref, out, and in in real code reviews?

### Simple Answer
ref means initialized before call and can be modified; out is assigned in method; in passes readonly by reference.

### Interview Answer
I use these sparingly because they affect API readability. I prefer return types or records for most business methods. I reserve out for Try-pattern methods, in for large readonly structs to avoid copying, and ref mainly for low-level performance-sensitive code where profiling proves value.

### Deep Explanation
- ref preserves aliasing and can create side effects.
- out guarantees assignment by callee.
- in avoids copy for large structs while preventing mutation in method body.

### Example
```csharp
public static bool TryParseId(string input, out int id)
{
    return int.TryParse(input, out id);
}

public static decimal Compute(in Money money)
{
    return money.Amount * 1.1m;
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Using ref for ordinary business logic and harming maintainability.
- Using in on tiny structs where it may not help.

### Follow-up Questions
- Why is out preferred in TryParse-style APIs?
- Can in parameters still cause defensive copies?

---

## Q5. var vs dynamic vs object [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
What is the production risk of dynamic?

### Simple Answer
var is compile-time inferred type, object is base CLR type, dynamic defers member binding to runtime.

### Interview Answer
dynamic is powerful but risky in backend services because compile-time safety is lost, refactoring safety drops, and runtime failures appear in edge cases. I use dynamic only at boundaries like JSON scripting or COM interoperability. For core domain code, I prefer explicit or inferred static typing.

### Deep Explanation
- var keeps static typing and full compiler checks.
- object requires casts/pattern checks.
- dynamic bypasses compile-time member resolution.

### Example
```csharp
dynamic d = "hello";
Console.WriteLine(d.Length); // runtime binder resolves

object o = "hello";
Console.WriteLine(((string)o).Length); // compile-time checked cast
```

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking var is weak typing.
- Using dynamic in core service logic.

### Follow-up Questions
- How does dynamic impact performance and debugging?
- Where is dynamic acceptable in production code?

---

## Q6. const vs readonly vs static readonly [ADVANCED]

### Question
Why can const become dangerous across assemblies?

### Simple Answer
const is compile-time substituted; readonly is runtime initialized once; static readonly is runtime initialized once per type.

### Interview Answer
const values are inlined into consuming assemblies at compile time. If a shared library changes a const and downstream apps are not rebuilt, they keep old values. For cross-assembly configuration-like constants, I prefer static readonly.

### Deep Explanation
- const requires compile-time constant.
- readonly can be set in constructor.
- static readonly can come from static constructor or initializer.

### Example
```csharp
public const int TimeoutSecondsConst = 30;
public static readonly int TimeoutSeconds = 30;
```

### Common Mistakes
- Using const for values expected to evolve.
- Confusing immutable reference with immutable object state.

### Follow-up Questions
- What is the binary compatibility issue with const?
- When is readonly enough instead of static readonly?

---

## Q7. String Immutability and StringBuilder [ADVANCED]

### Question
Why are strings immutable and when should StringBuilder be used?

### Simple Answer
String immutability improves safety and interning behavior. StringBuilder is better for many concatenations.

### Interview Answer
In APIs handling large payloads or loops, repeated string concatenation creates allocation churn. I switch to StringBuilder or spans when profiling shows pressure. For small fixed concatenations, modern compiler optimizations make simple plus operations fine.

### Deep Explanation
- Each concatenation can create a new string.
- StringBuilder amortizes buffer growth.
- Interpolated strings may still allocate depending on scenario.

### Example
```csharp
var sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    sb.Append(i).Append(',');
}
var result = sb.ToString();
```

### Common Mistakes
- Replacing every concatenation with StringBuilder prematurely.
- Ignoring culture-specific formatting concerns.

### Follow-up Questions
- How do you prove StringBuilder helps here?
- What alternatives exist for zero-allocation formatting?

---

## Q8. Nullable Reference Types: Compiler hint or real safety? [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
How do nullable reference types improve production quality?

### Simple Answer
They provide compile-time nullability analysis to reduce null reference exceptions.

### Interview Answer
Nullable reference types are one of the most practical reliability features in modern C#. They shift null bugs left into compile time. The value is highest when enabled solution-wide with strict warnings and consistent annotations on DTOs, APIs, and domain models.

### Deep Explanation
- string and string? convey intent.
- Compiler flow analysis tracks null-state.
- Attributes can improve analysis for guard methods.

### Example
```csharp
public string BuildDisplayName(string? first, string? last)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(first) && string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(last))
        return "Unknown";

    return $"{first} {last}".Trim();
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Enabling nullable but suppressing warnings everywhere.
- Using null-forgiving operator as a default habit.

### Follow-up Questions
- How would you migrate a legacy codebase gradually?
- What warning levels do you enforce in CI?

---

## Q9. is, as, and Pattern Matching [INTERMEDIATE]

### Question
When is pattern matching better than as-cast style?

### Simple Answer
Pattern matching is safer and clearer because it checks type and assigns strongly typed variable in one step.

### Interview Answer
I prefer pattern matching for readability and reduced null bugs. It also expresses intent better for discriminating union-like models and error handling branches. as with separate null checks is still valid but often more verbose.

### Deep Explanation
- is Type t introduces scoped variable.
- switch expressions can model decision trees cleanly.

### Example
```csharp
if (response is HttpResponseMessage http && http.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    // handle success
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Overusing deep nested patterns that reduce readability.
- Forgetting exhaustive handling in switch expressions.

### Follow-up Questions
- How do pattern matching and polymorphism complement each other?
- When does a switch expression become too complex?

---

## Q10. IEnumerable vs ICollection vs IList [ADVANCED]

### Question
How does choosing the wrong interface hurt API design?

### Simple Answer
Use the least powerful interface needed. IEnumerable for read-only iteration, ICollection for count/add/remove, IList for index-based operations.

### Interview Answer
Returning overly specific mutable interfaces leaks implementation details and invites misuse. For service boundaries, I generally return IReadOnlyCollection or IEnumerable depending on needs. For parameters, I request the smallest contract to keep code flexible and testable.

### Deep Explanation
- Narrow contracts reduce coupling.
- IList implies ordering and index-based semantics.
- ICollection implies mutation and count support.

### Example
```csharp
public IEnumerable<OrderDto> GetRecentOrders() => _orders.Select(Map);
```

### Common Mistakes
- Returning List directly from domain/service APIs.
- Assuming IEnumerable materialized once.

### Follow-up Questions
- Why might IReadOnlyList be better than IEnumerable in some cases?
- How does deferred execution affect repeated enumeration?

---

## Q11. IEnumerable vs IQueryable [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
Why is returning IQueryable from repository/service usually risky?

### Simple Answer
IQueryable carries query expression for translation; exposing it leaks data access concerns and can cause unpredictable SQL at higher layers.

### Interview Answer
I avoid returning IQueryable from business/service boundaries because callers can compose expensive or unsafe queries, making performance and behavior unpredictable. I prefer explicit query methods that return DTOs or materialized results with controlled includes, filters, paging, and projection.

### Deep Explanation
- IQueryable builds expression trees translated by provider (EF Core).
- Moving query composition outside data layer blurs responsibility.
- Harder to test and reason about generated SQL.

### Example
```csharp
// Prefer
Task<IReadOnlyList<UserSummary>> SearchUsersAsync(UserFilter filter, CancellationToken ct);

// Avoid exposing IQueryable across layers
IQueryable<User> QueryUsers();
```

### Common Mistakes
- Treating IQueryable as just another collection.
- Enumerating query multiple times with different side effects.

### Follow-up Questions
- When can exposing IQueryable be acceptable?
- How do you inspect generated SQL in EF Core?

---

## Q12. Delegates, Events, Func, Action, Predicate [ADVANCED]

### Question
How do these concepts appear in real systems?

### Simple Answer
Delegates represent callable methods; events provide publisher-subscriber notifications; Func/Action/Predicate are common generic delegate types.

### Interview Answer
In production, these are everywhere: LINQ pipelines, middleware chains, policies, callbacks, and domain events. The key is managing lifetime and avoiding memory leaks from long-lived publishers with short-lived subscribers.

### Deep Explanation
- Func returns value.
- Action returns void.
- Predicate returns bool.
- Events restrict external invocation to publisher.

### Example
```csharp
public event EventHandler<OrderCreatedEventArgs>? OrderCreated;

private void RaiseOrderCreated(Guid orderId)
{
    OrderCreated?.Invoke(this, new OrderCreatedEventArgs(orderId));
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Not unsubscribing from events in long-lived objects.
- Using events as distributed integration mechanism directly.

### Follow-up Questions
- How do you prevent event-based memory leaks?
- When to use mediator or message bus instead of in-process events?

---

## Q13. Lambda Expressions and Expression Trees [ADVANCED]

### Question
What is the practical difference between Func and Expression Func?

### Simple Answer
Func is compiled executable code; Expression Func is a data structure describing code, useful for translation.

### Interview Answer
This difference is critical in EF Core. Func filters in memory after data retrieval, while Expression Func can be translated to SQL. Misusing them can move filtering from DB to app memory and create severe performance issues.

### Deep Explanation
- Func<T, bool> executes directly.
- Expression<Func<T, bool>> can be inspected and translated by query providers.

### Example
```csharp
Expression<Func<User, bool>> serverFilter = u => u.IsActive;
Func<User, bool> inMemoryFilter = u => u.IsActive;
```

### Common Mistakes
- Passing Func to APIs expecting server-side translation.
- Building very complex expression trees without tests.

### Follow-up Questions
- How do you compose expression trees safely?
- How do expression trees affect caching of queries?

---

## Q14. Extension Methods, Generics, and Constraints [ADVANCED]

### Question
How can these improve design without overengineering?

### Simple Answer
Extension methods add reusable behavior; generics improve type safety and reuse; constraints limit valid type arguments for correctness.

### Interview Answer
I use extension methods for cross-cutting readability improvements and generics for reusable domain utilities. Constraints are important to encode assumptions at compile time, reducing runtime checks and invalid states.

### Deep Explanation
- where T : class enforces reference type.
- where T : struct enforces value type.
- where T : new() requires public parameterless constructor.

### Example
```csharp
public static class RetryExtensions
{
    public static async Task<T> WithRetryAsync<T>(this Func<Task<T>> action, int attempts)
    {
        Exception? last = null;
        for (int i = 0; i < attempts; i++)
        {
            try { return await action(); }
            catch (Exception ex) { last = ex; }
        }
        throw last ?? new InvalidOperationException("Retry failed.");
    }
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Dumping unrelated extension methods into one static class.
- Generic abstractions that hide simple intent.

### Follow-up Questions
- When can extension methods make discoverability worse?
- What constraints would you add for repository abstractions?

---

## Q15. Covariance and Contravariance [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
Where do variance concepts matter in day-to-day coding?

### Simple Answer
Covariance allows using more derived return types in compatible generic contexts; contravariance allows using less derived parameter types.

### Interview Answer
Variance matters in interfaces and delegates, especially when designing reusable APIs and event handlers. Correct variance reduces casting and improves substitutability, but wrong assumptions can produce compile-time confusion.

### Deep Explanation
- out type parameter means covariance.
- in type parameter means contravariance.
- Applies to interfaces and delegates with restrictions.

### Example
```csharp
IEnumerable<string> names = new List<string>();
IEnumerable<object> objs = names; // covariance

Action<object> handleObj = o => Console.WriteLine(o);
Action<string> handleStr = handleObj; // contravariance
```

### Common Mistakes
- Expecting variance on classes like List<T>.
- Misunderstanding direction of conversion.

### Follow-up Questions
- Why is List<T> invariant?
- How does variance impact API evolution?

---

## Q16. Records vs Classes and Struct vs Class [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
How do you choose among record class, class, record struct, and struct?

### Simple Answer
Use record for value-based equality models, class for identity/lifecycle entities, struct for small immutable value objects in hot paths.

### Interview Answer
For domain entities with identity and behavior, I use classes. For immutable DTO-like models and messages, records are expressive and reduce boilerplate. For tiny high-frequency value objects where copying is cheap and beneficial, readonly structs can help. I avoid mutable structs almost always.

### Deep Explanation
- Records default to value-based equality and with-expression support.
- Classes default to reference equality unless overridden.
- Structs avoid null by default but can still be nullable with T?.

### Example
```csharp
public record UserDto(Guid Id, string Email);
public class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Using records for EF entities without understanding tracking and equality implications.
- Making large structs and causing copy overhead.

### Follow-up Questions
- When does record equality become problematic?
- Why are structs risky as dictionary keys if mutable?

---

## Q17. Abstract Class vs Interface and Default Interface Methods [ADVANCED]

### Question
How do you decide between abstract class and interface in modern C#?

### Simple Answer
Interface defines contract; abstract class shares state/implementation. Default interface methods allow optional shared behavior but should be used carefully.

### Interview Answer
I start with interfaces for contracts and dependency boundaries. I use abstract base classes only when I need shared protected behavior or state. Default interface methods are useful for versioning shared contracts, but overuse can hide behavior and complicate testing/mocking.

### Deep Explanation
- Interface supports multiple inheritance of contracts.
- Abstract class supports single inheritance with implementation.
- Default interface methods can reduce breaking changes but should remain minimal.

### Example
```csharp
public interface IHealthCheck
{
    Task<bool> IsHealthyAsync(CancellationToken ct);

    async Task<bool> IsHealthyWithTimeoutAsync(TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        using var cts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(ct);
        cts.CancelAfter(timeout);
        return await IsHealthyAsync(cts.Token);
    }
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Using inheritance where composition is cleaner.
- Putting too much logic into default interface methods.

### Follow-up Questions
- How would you version an interface without default methods?
- What testing pitfalls come with default methods?

---

## Q18. virtual vs abstract vs override vs new (method hiding) [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
What bug patterns occur with method hiding vs overriding?

### Simple Answer
override participates in polymorphism; new hides base member and dispatch depends on reference type.

### Interview Answer
Method hiding causes surprising runtime behavior, especially in legacy code and framework extension points. I avoid new unless there is a deliberate reason and team agreement. In reviews, I flag hidden members because they often produce inconsistent behavior when object is referenced as base type.

### Deep Explanation
- abstract requires derived implementation.
- virtual provides default behavior that can be overridden.
- override replaces virtual behavior polymorphically.
- new creates a separate member, not polymorphic override.

### Example
```csharp
public class BaseProcessor
{
    public virtual string Name() => "Base";
}

public class ChildProcessor : BaseProcessor
{
    public new string Name() => "Child"; // hides, does not override
}

BaseProcessor p = new ChildProcessor();
var name = p.Name(); // "Base" not "Child"
```

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming new behaves like override.
- Forgetting base method must be virtual/abstract to override.

### Follow-up Questions
- How would you refactor hidden members safely?
- What tooling or analyzer rules can catch this?

---

## Q19. Access Modifiers, static classes, sealed classes, partial classes [INTERMEDIATE]

### Question
How do these modifiers impact architecture and maintainability?

### Simple Answer
Access modifiers enforce encapsulation; static classes model stateless utility behavior; sealed prevents inheritance; partial splits type definition across files.

### Interview Answer
I treat these as architecture controls, not syntax trivia. Narrow visibility reduces accidental coupling. static classes are good for pure helpers but harmful when used as hidden global dependencies. sealed improves predictability and can help JIT devirtualization in some cases. partial is useful for generated code boundaries.

### Deep Explanation
- Prefer private/internal by default and widen only when needed.
- sealed prevents misuse through inheritance.
- partial should not scatter business logic randomly.

### Example
```csharp
internal sealed class TokenValidator
{
    public bool IsValid(string token) => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(token);
}
```

### Common Mistakes
- Making everything public.
- Using static helpers that block testability due to hidden dependencies.
- Splitting partial classes without clear responsibility boundaries.

### Follow-up Questions
- When is internal better than public in multi-project solutions?
- How do you test static-heavy legacy code?

---

## Q20. Senior Misconception Drill (Rapid Traps) [SENIOR/TRICKY]

### Question
Address these common interview traps quickly:

1. Is var dynamic typing?
2. Are structs always faster than classes?
3. Is IEnumerable always in-memory data?
4. Is record always better than class?
5. Does new override base behavior polymorphically?

### Simple Answer
1. No.
2. No.
3. No.
4. No.
5. No.

### Interview Answer
All of these are context-dependent. Senior answers emphasize trade-offs, generated runtime behavior, memory implications, and maintainability.

### Deep Explanation
- var preserves static typing.
- Struct performance depends on size, mutability, copy frequency.
- IEnumerable can represent deferred pipelines.
- Records fit value semantics, not every domain model.
- new hides; override polymorphically replaces.

### Example
Use these traps as a final self-check before interviews: explain each with one practical bug you saw and one mitigation you now apply.

### Common Mistakes
- Giving absolute statements without context.
- Ignoring production impact and debugging consequences.

### Follow-up Questions
- Which of these traps have you seen in real code reviews?
- How do you teach juniors to avoid these mistakes?

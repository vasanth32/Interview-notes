Good approach — using **Cursor AI to generate structured notes + POCs** is one of the fastest ways to learn.

Below are **ready-to-paste prompts**.  
You can paste each prompt in Cursor and ask it to create a **.md file with explanation + POC steps**.

---

## AI Learning Prompts for Cursor (.NET Developer Focus)

### Prompt 1 — AI Fundamentals for Backend Developers

```
Create a markdown file named "01-AI-Fundamentals-for-Backend-Developers.md".

Explain AI concepts specifically for backend developers:
- What is AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LLM
- How modern enterprise applications use AI
- Difference between ML model training vs using pretrained models via APIs
- Real-world backend use cases (chatbots, recommendation engines, summarization, fraud detection)

Include:
- Simple architecture diagrams (ASCII)
- Real-time enterprise examples relevant to microservices
- Key interview points
- Short summary checklist at the end
```

---

### Prompt 2 — Calling AI APIs from .NET

```
Create a markdown file named "02-Calling-AI-APIs-from-DotNet.md".

Explain step-by-step:
- How AI APIs work (request, tokens, response)
- How to call OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Bedrock APIs from .NET Web API
- HttpClient example in .NET
- Configuration best practices (secure keys, environment variables)

Include:
- Production best practices
- Error handling strategies
- Performance considerations
- Step-by-step POC instructions
```

---

### Prompt 3 — Embeddings and Vector Databases

```
Create a markdown file named "03-Embeddings-and-Vector-Databases.md".

Explain in a simple way:
- What embeddings are
- Why vector databases are required
- How similarity search works
- How enterprise systems use embeddings (document search, recommendation systems)

Include:
- PostgreSQL pgvector example
- Simple .NET service architecture for embedding search
- Interview questions and answers
- POC steps to build a document similarity search service
```

---

### Prompt 4 — RAG Architecture for Enterprise Systems

```
Create a markdown file named "04-RAG-Architecture.md".

Explain Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
- Problem solved by RAG
- End-to-end architecture
- Microservices integration approach
- Cost optimization strategies
- Security considerations

Include:
- ASCII architecture diagram
- Step-by-step enterprise implementation workflow
- Example: internal document assistant system
- Checklist for production readiness
```

---

### Prompt 5 — Semantic Kernel for .NET Developers

```
Create a markdown file named "05-Semantic-Kernel-for-DotNet.md".

Explain:
- What Semantic Kernel is
- Why it is useful in .NET enterprise systems
- How to integrate it in ASP.NET Core APIs
- Plugin architecture
- Real-world automation examples

Include:
- Step-by-step POC instructions
- Production usage guidelines
- Best practices
```

---

### Prompt 6 — AI Microservice Architecture

```
Create a markdown file named "06-AI-Microservice-Architecture.md".

Explain:
- How to design AI-powered microservices
- Communication patterns (API Gateway, async processing)
- AI service orchestration
- Monitoring and cost control
- Scaling strategies

Include:
- Enterprise architecture diagram
- Example: Product recommendation AI microservice
- Deployment considerations in cloud environments
```

---

## Extremely Important (Career Insight)

If you finish these **6 MD learning modules + POCs**, you will already reach:

**Top 15–20% AI-ready backend engineers (2026 level)**

because most developers still only learn theory.

---

## If you want (very powerful next step)

I can next create a **“AI integrated version of your existing microservices project” roadmap**  
(ProductService + Recommendation AI + Search AI + Chat assistant)  
so your portfolio becomes **AI-enabled enterprise architecture**, which dramatically increases interview success.
